# Competitive Programming

Personal development repository where I save all my solved exercises in UVa Online Judge and the Portugal's National Qualifier for IOI.

## The Why

I am terribly passionate about puzzles and complicated exercises. I love to solve the exercises that my peers seem to be way too hard, problems which are confusing to me as well. Even though I haven't qualified for IOI, it's a wish of mine.
I am in a permanent mission to become as capable as I can to solve the hardest CS problems.
